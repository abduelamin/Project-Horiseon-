# Project-Horiseon-

## Introduction

Horiseon is a Social Solution Services agency that enhances online businesses through SEO and social media marketing, aiming to increase customers and overall business growth.

- A very important aspect of webpages is accessibility and ensuring they cater to all individuals. This project hightlights and improves HTML and CSS code for readability and accessibility. Therefore, with this project I learnt the importance of avoiding code repetition and making the code concise, otherwise you may encounter files with 1000's of lines of code. This does not follow good practices which makes the work look unprofessional.
